                <div class="panel">
                    <p>I'm developing a 2D game with my wonderful wife using C# and the Unity engine. This project aims to showcase my creativity and programming skills while exploring the intricacies of game development. I'm excited to bring this vision to life and create an engaging gaming experience.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>I'm developing a terminal-based Kanban board that leverages Linux commands for manipulation. This project aims to streamline task management and enhance productivity by providing a seamless interface for organizing and tracking tasks.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>I'm working on a Go-based and a Rust-based data tool pack that enables data science and analytics professionals to leverage the Rust language. This initiative seeks to empower users with efficient and high-performance tools for data processing, analysis, and visualization.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>I'm developing a synchronization application tailored for removable storage. This application ensures seamless syncing of sensitive directories, such as Git repositories, while handling line-ending conversions, local discovery, and sync change management. Additionally, I'm incorporating the option to symlink externally post-sync.</p>

                    <p>My work involves creating a dotfile synchronization application. This tool empowers me to apply settings to non-configurable applications on mobile devices through AHK, Tasker, and iOS actions. This will also pull configurations over SSH or SCP from devices that generally dont support symlinking into a git repo like my router and unraid server. The goal is to achieve a consistent experience across platforms.</p>
