                <h3>Sync Application for Removable Storage</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm developing a synchronization application tailored for removable storage. This application ensures seamless syncing of sensitive directories, such as Git repositories, while handling line-ending conversions, local discovery, and sync change management. Additionally, I'm incorporating the option to symlink externally post-sync.

                <h3>Dotfile Sync Application</h3>
                <p>
                    My work involves creating a dotfile synchronization application. This tool empowers me to apply settings to non-configurable applications on mobile devices through AHK, Tasker, and iOS actions. The goal is to achieve a consistent experience across platforms.
